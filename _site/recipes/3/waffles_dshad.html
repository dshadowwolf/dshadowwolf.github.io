                <p id="recipe_description">If you're an American and you've never had Waffles, then you've been living in denial long enough. Truthfully... The word "Waffle" first appears in English in the 1725 cookbook <a href="https://archive.org/details/b30510211">"Court Cookery"</a> (page 176), but is a much older dish with roots able to be traced back to the 13th Century as a variation of the Catholic "Communion Wafer".

The modern form is a fast-rising and simple batter based food, compared to the old yeast leavened or unleavened forms.</p>

                    <li>Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make sure they are well mixed.</li>
                    
                    <li>Make a small well in the middle of the dry ingredients, then add the melted butter and mix well</li>
                    
                    <li>Add the egg and milk. Mix well but do not over mix or over "beat" the batter as this can develop too much gluten for the waffles to rise well</li>
                    
                    <li>Following your waffle irons directions cook your waffles.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong><em>(Optional Step)</em></strong> Lightly toast/crisp the waffles by putting them in an oven at around 300F for two to five minutes.</li>
                    
                </ol>
                
                <ul class="instruction-notes">
                    
                    <li>If you want chocolate chip, blueberry or other additional flavors in your waffles, add them at the same time as the egg and milk</li>
                    
                    <li>This recipe doesn't scale up with the ingredients in a flatly linear manner. Just doubling everything to make a double batch will make the waffles try to over-rise and they will come out tasting strongly of eggs.</li>
