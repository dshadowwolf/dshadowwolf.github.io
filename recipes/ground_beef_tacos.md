Tacos are a classic Mexican dish that almost anyone is familiar with, what follows is [my](https://github.com/dshadowwolf) personal recipe for them.

### Ingredients:
* Meats
  - [ ] 1 pound lean ground beef (80/20 is best, but anything less than 70/30 is bad for this recipe)
  
* Spices
  - [ ] 2 tablespoons your choice of Chili Powder
    - I, personally, use 1 tablespoon each of ground Piquin and Guajillo chili's
  - [ ] 1 teaspoon light brown sugar
  - [ ] 1 teaspoon Cumin
  - [ ] 1 teaspoon Coriander
  - [ ] 1/2 teaspoon Oregano
  - [ ] 1/4 teaspoon cocoa powder
  - [ ] 1/8 teaspoon paprika
  - [ ] 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
    - You can substitute Chipotle here, but it throws off the flavor somewhat, IMO
  - [ ] salt to taste
  
* Vegetables
  - [ ] 1 medium to large onion, minced
  - [ ] 3 cloves fresh garlic, minced
    - I've been known to splurge here and use several tablespoons pre-minced, but this is a personal taste thing
  
* Liquids
  - [ ] 1/2 cup tomato sauce
    - You can use a full cup, but this might make it "too tomato" in flavor
  - [ ] 1/2 cup vegetable or chicken broth
  - [ ] 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar

### Instructions:
1. Sautee onions in your choice of oil (1 tablespoon should be enough) until soft, but have not changed color.
2. Add garlic and spices (not the brown sugar), mix well. Cook until fragrant - should be 30 seconds to a minute.
3. Add beef, breaking it up and cooking until "not pink" (ie: done but not "well done") - this should take 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Stir in tomato sauce, broth, vinegar and sugar.
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer. The whole mix will thicken. This should take 10 to 15 minutes at a medium heat.
  * Taste throughout, add salt as needed
