igdt: [ { amount: 1 cup, name: All Purpose Flour, notes: or 250ml for those in Metric areas }, { amount: 1 cup, name: Milk, notes: or 250ml for those in Metric areas }, { amount: 4 ounces, name: Salted Butter, notes: or 120g for those in Metric areas }, { amount: 4, name: Fresh Eggs, notes: "" } ]
insns: [ "Pre-heat the oven to 375° Fahrenheit (190° Celsius)", "Use the eggbeater to blend the eggs together into a yellowish goop. Set the beater/blender on 'high'; you want to force a bunch of teeny little air bubbles into the batter in colloid suspension.", "Add the milk to said goop, blending all the while.", "Stir/blend the flour into the egg/milk proto-batter", "After the oven reaches the desired temperature, put the butter in the pan, and then put the pan in the oven.", "Keep stirring/blending the batter while the butter is hotting up.", "When the butter is completely melted, pour the batter into the pan.", "Cook for about 12 minutes, or until the batter is a friendly golden-brown with inviting 'hills' billowing up from its surface, whichever comes first.", "When the pancake is done, its edges should be rising/curling up like a big bowl (see also: \"empty space above the pan\"). Together with the billowy hills in the center, it's quite impressive-looking.", "Carve that sucker up like a pizza pie. Serves as many as 8-12, depending on how big you make the slices." ]
variations: [ "This recipe assumes you’re using a pan that holds four quarts. If your pan is larger or smaller, no problem; you can scale it up or down as needed, depending on the size of the pan you're gonna cook it in. Let N be the number of quarts (liters) of water your pan can hold; you'll want N eggs, N/4 cups (N * 60-odd ml) of milk, N/4 cups (N * 60-odd ml) of flour, and N ounces (N * 30 g) of butter (up to a maximum of N=4; as long as you've got enough butter to 'wet' most of the pan's bottom when said butter melts, you should be good to go). If you do go for a bigger Dutch Baby, you may want a mixing bowl that's larger than 2 quarts.", "Margarine can be substituted for butter with little/no ill effect.", "The butter gives it enough flavor (salt) that this can be eaten as it stands. At the same time, the recipe is sufficiently 'neutral' that you can get away with adding a wide variety of other ingredients, if you like; you can add sliced hotdogs to the pre-cooking batter, or slather fruit preserves on the finished pancake, or add pretty much anything else within arm's reach of 'edible', really." ]
equip: [ "A paella pan—any round, shallow, wide pan with a flat bottom and sloping sides should do nicely.", "A 2-quart (2-liter) mixing bowl.", "Eggbeater. Electric, manual, whatever works for you.", "Measuring cups. You'll want two—one for the milk, and one for the flour. Unless you're okay with using the same cup for both milk and flour, in which case, go right ahead [shrug].", "Functioning oven. You'll want the pan to have a lot of empty space above it, so arrange the cooking racks accordingly." ]
