name: Old Fashioned Waffles
title: Waffles, Classic
description: "If you're an American and you've never had Waffles, then you've been living in denial long enough. Truthfully... The word \"Waffle\" first appears in English in the 1725 cookbook <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/b30510211\">\"Court Cookery\"</a> (page 176), but is a much older dish with roots able to be traced back to the 13th Century as a variation of the Catholic \"Communion Wafer\".\n\nThe modern form is a fast-rising and simple batter based food, compared to the old yeast leavened or unleavened forms."
ingredients: [ { section: Dry Ingredients, parts: [ { amount: 1 cup, name: All Purpose Flour, notes: [] }, { amount: 1 tbsp, name: Granulated Sugar, notes: [] }, { amount: 1 tsp, name: Baking Powder, notes: [] }, { amount: ½ tsp Baking Soda, notes: [] }, { amount: ½ tsp, name: Salt, notes: [] } ] }, { section: Dairy, parts: [ { amount: 1 cup, name: Milk, notes: [] }, { amount: 1, name: Large Egg, notes: [] }, { amount: ¼ cup, name: Unsalted Butter (melted), notes: [] } ] }, { section: Other, parts: [ { amount: "", name: Vegetable Oil, notes: [ "For greasing the waffle iron.", "Butter and things such as Pam Spray can be substituted" ] } ] } ]
instructions: [ "Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make sure they are well mixed.", "Make a small well in the middle of the dry ingredients, then add the melted butter and mix well", "Add the egg and milk. Mix well but do not over mix or over \"beat\" the batter as this can develop too much gluten for the waffles to rise well", "Following your waffle irons directions cook your waffles.", "<strong><em>(Optional Step)</em></strong> Lightly toast/crisp the waffles by putting them in an oven at around 300F for two to five minutes." ]
instruction_notes: [ "If you want chocolate chip, blueberry or other additional flavors in your waffles, add them at the same time as the egg and milk", "This recipe doesn't scale up with the ingredients in a flatly linear manner. Just doubling everything to make a double batch will make the waffles try to over-rise and they will come out tasting strongly of eggs." ]
