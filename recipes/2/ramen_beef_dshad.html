title: Beef Ramen
name: Beef Ramen
description: "The classic Japanese noodle soup, with nearly every region of the country having its own variation. After World War 2 it started to become a staple of the struggling nation thanks to cheap wheat flour flooding in from the United States. Then, in 1958, the Found and Chairman of Nissin Foods&mdash;Momofuku Ando (安藤 百福) invented instant Ramen. In the 1980's this food was becoming a Japanese cultural icon and the low price of the Instant variety has seen it become a staple food of cash-strapped college students everywhere.\n\nPresented here is an attempt at a much healthier version of the classic. Do note that this has some preparatory steps that need to be done hours before actually preparing the final dish."
