## Classic Sausage Gravy
Almost everyone in America has had this white, pepper gravy with bits of sausage in it at some point.

This is a version of what my mother used to make, modified to give more control over the flavor.

### Ingredients
* Meat(s)
  - [ ] 1 lb plain ground sausage
    - I prefer to use classic Pork sausage, but you can change this as needed
	
* Spices
  - [ ] 1 tsp Sage
  - [ ] 1 tsp Savory
  - [ ] 1 tsp Thyme
  - [ ] 1 tsp Oregano
  - [ ] 2 or 3 tbsp Ground Black Pepper
  - [ ] salt to taste
  
* Liquids
  - [ ] 3 cups Milk

* Other
  - [ ] 1/3 cup plain white flour
  
### Instructions
1. Put sausage and spices in a pan on medium-high heat. Mix and cook sausage until no longer pink, stirring frequently and breaking up into small chunks
2. Turn down heat to medium-low and add the flour to the pan. Mix well - the flour will stick to the sausage and absorb the grease in the pan.
3. When the flour starts to cook, add the milk and turn the heat up to a firm medium.
4. As the milk starts to simmer, add the pepper and stir well.
5. Stir frequently as the mix starts to thicken.
6. As the gravy reaches its final thickness (this should be, at most, 10 minutes after the milk started to simmer), taste it and add any salt needed for your preferred flavor or need.
