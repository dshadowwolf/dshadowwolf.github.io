instructions: [ "In a small bowl mix the Mirin, Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil and Honey", "Mix into that mixture of liquids the Pho, Curry and Boillon pastes. Set this aside for later", "Over a medium-low heat toast the remaining spices (not the Saffron)", "Add the vegetables and 1 teaspoon of your choice of cooking oil. Sautee until the vegetables start to \"wilt\" but stop before they begin to caramelize", "Add the meats to the pan and cook well, breaking up the sausage and chorizo until everything is finely distributed", "When meat is about half done, start cooking the rice in the water", "When meat is done, add the paste-like liquid mixture that was set aside earlier. Use a silicone or rubber spatula to get as much as possible into the pot. Mix well, cover the pot and turn down the heat", "When the rice is done, mix in the Saffron. The rice will turn a nice yellow-orange color", "Add the rice to the pot, mix well and let simmer, uncovered, at a medium-low heat until it begins to thicken. When it thickens up a bit, it is ready to serve" ]
instruction_notes: [ "If the curry is still too soupy, add a teaspoon or two of flour, corn starch or mung bean starch (only 1 of these is needed!)" ]
