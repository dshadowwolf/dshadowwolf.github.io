title: Beef Tacos
name: Beef Tacos
description: "Sometimes considered a simple dish it is surprisingly a hard one to get truly right and an easy one to wind up with \"not quite right\". What follows is <a href=\"https://github.com/dshadowwolf\">my</a> personal recipe for this classic dish."
ingredients: [ { section: Meats, parts: [ { amount: 1 pound, name: Ground Beef, notes: [ "You really want a lean ground beef for this&mdash;no less than 70/30 but no leaner than 80/20 or flavor will be lost" ] } ] }, { section: Spices, parts: [ { amount: 2 tbsp, name: Chili Powder, notes: [ "Up to you what to use", "Personally I use 1 tablespoon of Chili Arbol and 1 tablespoon of Chili Guajillo" ] }, { amount: 1 tsp, name: Light Brown Sugar, notes: [] }, { amount: 1 tsp, name: Cumin Powder, notes: [] }, { amount: 1 tsp, name: Coriander Powder, notes: [] }, { amount: ½ tsp, name: Oregano, notes: [ "While I generally prefer the dried, crushed form of this herb, for this recipe I find that powdered is better" ] }, { amount: ¼ tsp, name: Cocoa Powder, notes: [] }, { amount: ⅛ tsp, name: Paprika, notes: [] }, { amount: ⅛ tsp, name: Cayenne Pepper, notes: [ "Normally I'd suggest trying Chipotle in place of Cayenne, but having done that myself, I'll just say <strong><em>DON'T!</em></strong>" ] } ] }, { section: Vegetables, parts: [ { amount: 1 medium, name: White Onion, note: [ "As long as it is at least medium sized, the amount of onion isn't critical in the long run. Just don't go with a small onion." ] }, { amount: 3 cloves, name: Garlic (minced), notes: [ "I'm a bit of a garlic lover and have really splurged on the amount of garlic in the past. This really is a personal taste kind of thing." ] } ] }, { section: Liquids, parts: [ { amount: 1 cup, name: Tomato Sauce, notes: [ "Too much or too little can ruin the flavor of the taco filling" ] }, { amount: ½ cup, name: Beef Stock, notes: [ "You can use Vegetable or Chicken Stock here" ] }, { amount: 2 tsp, name: Balsamic Vinegar, notes: [ "I've tried Cider Vinegar, Mirin and plain White Vinegar. Balsamic seems to work the best." ] } ] } ]
instructions: [ "Sautee onions in your choice of oil (1 tablespoon should be enough) until soft, but have not changed color.", "Add garlic and spices (not the brown sugar), mix well. Cook until fragrant&mdash;this should be 30 seconds to a minute.", "Add beef, breaking it up and cooking until \"not pink\" (ie: done but not \"well done\")&mdash;this should take 5 to 10 minutes.", "Stir in tomato sauce, broth, vinegar and sugar.", "Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer. The whole mix will thicken. This should take 10 to 15 minutes at a medium heat." ]
instruction_notes: [ "Take small tastes throughout the cooking at every step from the meat finishing cooking. Add salt as needed." ]
