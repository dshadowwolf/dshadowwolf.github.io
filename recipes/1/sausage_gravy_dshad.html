title: Sausage Gravy
name: Sausage (or "Country") Gravy
description: "An old staple in large swathes of the United States, this is a variation on a Bechamel sauce that has a base in milk or cream."
ingredients: [ { section: Meats, parts: [ { amount: 1 pound, name: Ground Sausage, notes: [ "Get a plain, unspiced sausage for best results" ] } ] }, { section: Spices, parts: [ { amount: 1 tsp, name: Sage, notes: [] }, { amount: 1 tsp, name: Savory, notes: [] }, { amount: 1 tsp, name: Thyme, notes: [] }, { amount: 1 tsp, name: Oregano, notes: [] }, { amount: 2 tbsp, name: Ground Black Pepper, notes: [] }, { amount: "", name: Salt, notes: [ "How much salt is needed in this recipe is one of personal preference" ] } ] }, { section: Liquids, parts: [ { amount: 3 cups, name: Milk, notes: [ "You can use cream, but I have no experience with that" ] } ] }, { section: Other, parts: [ { amount: â…“ cup, name: White All-Purpose Flour, notes: [] } ] } ]
instructions: [ "Brown sausage with the spices on a medium-high heat, mixing well and breaking the sausage into small chunks.", "Turn down the heat to medium-low and mix in the flour. It will stick to the sausage and absorb the grease left from cooking the sausage. Keep stirring until the flour starts to cook&mdash;you should be able to smell a strong scent of the flour when this happens.", "Slowly add the milk so as not to scorch it, stirring well to dissolve the flour into it and get the thickening process primed.", "Keep stirring and add the pepper as the gravy starts to thicken", "Stir infrequently but otherwise let the mix come to a low simmer and cook down a little. It will thicken into the recognizable gravy. Taste and add any needed salt at this point." ]
instruction_notes: [ "Don't panic if it seems like it isn't thickening up. This might mean you've got some flour unmixed in the pan&mdash;Use a bamboo scraper or wooden spoon to break up any clumps that may have formed." ]
