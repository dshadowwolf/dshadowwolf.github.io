## Curry, American Style
### AKA: DShadowWolf's Spicy Rice, DShadowWolf's Food Crack, etc...

Curry is a traditionally Indian dish that has become something of a staple in most of the Orient. The name arises from the fact that, in Southern India, the leaves of the curry tree are an integral ingredient.

This recipe is constantly in flux and changing as [I](https://github.com/dshadowwolf) learn more about cooking and what flavors truly blend well together.

### Ingredients
* Meats
  - [ ] 1 pound Sausage
  - [ ] 1 pound Mexican Chorizo, mild
  - [ ] 4 slices thick cut bacon, diced
  
* Vegetables
  - [ ] 1 medium white onion
  - [ ] 1 large green bell pepper
  - [ ] 1 1/2 cups chopped spring onion
  - [ ] 1/2 cup diced daikon radish

* Grains
  - [ ] 1 cup rice, uncooked
    - I prefer to use Jasmine Rice for this dish, but I have used Basmati and several others
	- You can substitute chow mein noodles or similar here

* Spices
  - [ ] 1 tsp Sage
  - [ ] 1 tsp Oregano
  - [ ] 1/2 tsp Thyme
  - [ ] 1/4 tsp Marjoram
  - [ ] 1/4 tsp "Five Spice Powder"
  - [ ] 1/4 tsp Lemon Grass (powder)
  - [ ] 1 tablespoon Curry Paste
    - I use Masaman Yellow, but many other varieties are just as good
  - [ ] 1/2 tsp Pho Paste
  - [ ] 1/2 tsp "Better than Boillon" paste
  - [ ] 1/8 gram Saffron Powder
  
* Liquids
  - [ ] 2 tbsp Mirin (Rice Wine Vinegar)
  - [ ] 2 tsp Honey or Agave Nectar
  - [ ] 3 tbsp Soy Sauce
  - [ ] 1 tsp Sesame Oil
  - [ ] 2 cups Water
    - adjust to match how much is recommended for the 1 cup of uncooked rice.
	- Basmati, for example, only needs 1.5 cups of water for 1 cups of uncooked rice
	
### Instructions
1. In a small bowl mix the Mirin, Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil and Honey.
2. Mix into that mixture of liquids the Pho, Curry and Boillon pastes. Set this aside for later.
3. Over a medium-low heat toast the remaining spices (not the Saffron)
4. Add the vegetables and 1 teaspoon of your choice of cooking oil. Sautee until the vegetables start to "wilt" but stop before they begin to caramelize.
5. Add the meats to the pan and cook well, breaking up the sausage and chorizo until everything is finely distributed.
6. When meat is about half done, start cooking the rice in the water.
7. When meat is done, add the paste-like liquid mixture that was set aside earlier. Use a silicone or rubber spatula to get as much as possible into the pot. Mix well, cover the pot and turn down the heat.
8. When the rice is done, mix in the Saffron. The rice will turn a nice yellow-orange color.
9. Add the rice to the pot, mix well and let simmer, uncovered, at a medium-low heat until it begins to thicken. When it thickens up a bit, it is ready to serve.
* If the curry is still too soupy, add a teaspoon or two of flour, corn starch or mung bean starch (only 1 of these is needed!)
