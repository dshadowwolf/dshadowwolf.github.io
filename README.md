# Blargh!

This is where @dshadowwolf and friends are building up an online cookbook for their own use and for sharing with others.

You can see it live at https://dshadowwolf.github.io

## Notes

The theme in use for this site is a heavily modified form of GitHub's own [Hacker Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker). At this point almost all that remains is some CSS and a tiny bit of HTML. But credit where credit is due.

## License Woes (oh noes!)
The "Cookbook" theme is licensed under the MIT License, save for those portions that remain of "Hacker" from GitHub, which are under the CC0 license.

The actual content of the site is copyright the respective authors and, at this time, there is no cohesive license proposed, though @dshadowwolf (that is, me) would like to see it all under a CC license, preferably Non-Commercial, Share Alike.
